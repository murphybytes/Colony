Colony makes it easy to build distributed systems comprised of processes that send each other messages.  
Processes are given names according to their purpose.  Typically you would have multiple copies of 
each type of process for redundancy and/or load distribution.


How to set up a node
-----------------------

Declare a class and include Colony::Node

1) Supply name for the node you created

class MyNode
      include Colony::Node
      role 'my_node'	               # name of this node, must be unique
      on_message_call :on_message      # handler for messages from other nodes
      run_program_with :runner         # main program loop

      def on_message message
      	  # do something
      end

      def runner
         # main program loop
      end
